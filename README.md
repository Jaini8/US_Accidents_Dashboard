## US Accidents Dashboard

#### Team members: Jaini Patel, Arun Subbaiah, Moriah Walker. (Group-3)

### About:

In this project, we have designed and developed an interactive dashboard to explore the US Accidents Database available from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) & Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS) from National Highway Transport Safety Authority (NHTSA), which has information of fatal accidents that happened in the United States from the year 2000 to 2019. The datasets used for this project are fatal accidents dataset, which gives the information about the accidents; persons dataset, which gives the information about the people involved in those accidents and the vehicles dataset, which gives the information about the vehicles involved in those accidents. 

The main goal of this project is to make use of visual analytics concepts learned in this class to create a tool that gives more understanding to all the stakeholders & help make policies that reduce the road accidents in the US. 

Expected Users of this dashboard are, Department of Transportation, Traffic Control Room, Stakeholders in National/State Transport System and Car Manufacturers.
